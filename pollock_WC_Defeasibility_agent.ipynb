    "A **Pollock-style defeasible reasoning** system for workers' compensation claim analysis, built with **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Defeasible Reasoning**: Claims are analyzed through a belief-rule-defeater architecture inspired by John Pollock's epistemology. Conclusions are provisional and revisable.\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Specialized agents handle belief management, plan management, claim analysis, and regulatory search.\n",
    "- **Structured Defeaters**: Each potential issue is classified (undercutting, rebutting, regulatory, evidential) with severity scores that determine step status.\n",
    "- **Iterative Investigation Loop**: QUESTIONED steps trigger an investigation agent to suggest additional evidence, enabling human-in-the-loop refinement.\n",
    "- **Workers' Comp Domain Rules**: Employment eligibility, course of employment, notice deadlines, fraud indicators, and severity-based review requirements.\n",

      "\n",
      "Alright, I'm ready to dive into this Workers' Comp claim using my preferred Pollock-style defeasible reasoning. Let's break this down systematically. First, I'll initialize the claim plan. I'm going to assign the claim ID \"WC-2025-Indiana-001\" – seems like a good starting point. Jurisdiction is Indiana, the claim description is \"Broken foot from falling off a forklift,\" and based on the severity, which looks like \"off work,\" I'm starting with a \"moderate\" severity level. I can always adjust that later if the evidence warrants it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next up, adding beliefs from the intake data. I'm going to meticulously go through each data point and call the `add_belief` function for each piece of information. \"Work-related=Yes,\" \"Jurisdiction=Indiana,\" the claimant's occupation, age, injury details, date reported, prior injuries (or lack thereof), current work status, and the requested benefits – all get logged. Crucially, I'm also going to add that \"potential_intoxication=Yes\" belief, even though it's based on witness statements. I'll assign it a lower strength, 0.7, since it's not directly confirmed but is still a critical potential defeater. This is a red flag I can't ignore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I'm ready to evaluate the defeasibility rules. Time to call the `evaluate_workers_comp_rules` function. I'm eager to see how the system handles this potentially complex scenario with the intoxication factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the recommendation. Based on the output of the rule evaluation, I'm expecting this potential intoxication to have a major impact. My gut tells me this is going to push me toward an \"INVESTIGATE FURTHER\" recommendation. If that witness statement is confirmed, it could be a fatal defeater, rendering the claim invalid. I need to know more before I can confidently make a final decision, but this initial analysis is already pointing in that direction. This is the beauty of this system – it flags those critical issues that warrant further scrutiny.\n",

      "    *   **Kind:** Evidential\n",
      "    *   **Severity:** 0.65\n",

      "2.  **Target Step:** `wc-step-3` (Collect and validate medical evidence)\n",

      "    *   **Reason:** \"Ensure all employer incident reports, safety logs, and witness statements regarding the forklift fall are collected and reviewed for details on the incident and claimant's condition.\"\n",

      "*   **SUPPORTED:** 5 steps (Steps `wc-step-2`, `wc-step-5`, `wc-step-6`, `wc-step-7`, `wc-step-8` are currently supported, meaning no significant defeaters directly impacting them were found at this stage, or their preconditions are met.)\n",

      "\n",
      "**INVESTIGATE FURTHER**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Justification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the Pollock-style defeasible reasoning analysis, the claim currently presents a critical unresolved issue concerning the potential intoxication of the employee at the time of injury. While initial beliefs indicate the injury was work-related, the \"claim:potential_intoxication=Yes\" belief (though with a strength of 0.7, indicating it's not fully confirmed) has triggered significant evidential defeaters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically:\n",
      "*   `wc-step-4` (Evaluate compensability) is **QUESTIONED** due to the high risk that intoxication could negate compensability under Indiana law.\n",
      "*   `wc-step-3` (Collect and validate medical evidence) is **QUESTIONED** because crucial evidence, a toxicology report, is pending or needs to be obtained.\n",
      "*   `wc-step-1` (Initial claim intake and incident verification) is **QUESTIONED** as further investigation into incident reports and witness statements is required to corroborate or refute the intoxication claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without further investigation into the allegation of alcohol consumption and the collection of definitive evidence (such as a toxicology report), a determination of APPROVE or DENY would be premature and not auditable. The severity of the defeaters, particularly the one impacting compensability, necessitates a thorough follow-up before any final decision can be made.\n",
